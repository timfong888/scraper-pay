# scraper-pay
A service that enables content providers to request payment from scrapers for payment.

## North Star Mission
Enabling thriving content sites in the age of AI.

- Content web site creators have this problem: being scraped by AI's directing away traffic and impacting revenue
- To solve it, we should do this: allow web sites to enable by-the-byte micro-payments by AI agents
- Then our users will be better off: they can make additional revenue from all scrapers and increase revenue from casual readers
- This is good for my start-up: we should charge a % of fees collected
- Here's how we'll know if it worked: someone uses it and transactions are completed
